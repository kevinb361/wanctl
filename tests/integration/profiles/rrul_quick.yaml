# Quick RRUL test profile for CI/development
#
# Runs a 30-second RRUL test for faster feedback during
# development and CI pipelines. Less thorough than standard
# but catches obvious regressions.
#
# Target: Dallas netperf server (104.200.21.31)
# Duration: 30 seconds with 3s warmup/cooldown
# Purpose: Quick smoke test for CI
