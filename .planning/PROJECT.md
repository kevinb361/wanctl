# wanctl

## What This Is

wanctl is an adaptive CAKE bandwidth controller for MikroTik RouterOS that continuously monitors network latency and adjusts queue limits in real-time, with optional multi-WAN steering for latency-sensitive traffic.

## Core Value

Sub-second congestion detection with 50ms control loops, achieved through systematic performance optimization and code quality improvements while maintaining production reliability.

## Current Milestone: v1.5 Quality & Hygiene

**Goal:** Improve code quality tooling, remove accumulated debt, and ensure documentation accuracy.

**Target features:**

- Test coverage measurement with pytest-cov
- Codebase cleanup (dead code, TODOs, complexity)
- Documentation verification (version numbers, examples)
- Dependency security audit

## Current State (v1.4)

- **Version:** v1.4 Observability (shipped 2026-01-24)
- **Cycle Interval:** 50ms (40x faster than original 2s baseline)
- **Tests:** 745 passing
- **LOC:** ~25,900 Python
- **Status:** Production stable, steering health endpoint on port 9102

### Active

**Ongoing:**

- [ ] Confidence-based steering validation (enabled 2026-01-23, monitoring)

### Deferred

- [ ] SSH connection pooling — Low ROI, REST API already optimal
- [ ] CAKE stats caching — Not needed, flash wear protection working

### Out of Scope

- Machine learning-based bandwidth prediction — unnecessary complexity
- Prometheus/Grafana integration — not core to functionality
- Breaking changes to configuration format — maintain compatibility
- Support for non-RouterOS devices — focused on existing integration

## Context

wanctl is a production dual-WAN controller deployed in a home network environment. Reliability and backward compatibility are critical.

**Architecture:** Layered design (Router Control → Measurement → Congestion Assessment → State Management → Control Logic). Python 3.12 with Ruff linting, pytest testing, proper error handling.

**v1.0 Performance Optimization (2026-01-13):**

- Profiled 352,730 samples, discovered 30-41ms cycles (not ~200ms as assumed)
- Reduced cycle interval from 2s to 50ms (40x faster)
- Event loop architecture replaced timer-based execution
- See: `docs/PRODUCTION_INTERVAL.md`

**v1.1 Code Quality (2026-01-14):**

- 10 phases of systematic refactoring (Phases 6-15)
- Created shared modules: signal_utils.py, systemd_utils.py
- Consolidated 4 redundant utility modules
- Documented 12 refactoring opportunities in CORE-ALGORITHM-ANALYSIS.md
- Extracted methods from WANController and SteeringDaemon
- Unified state machine (CAKE-aware + legacy)
- Integrated Phase2BController with dry-run mode
- Added 120 new tests (474 → 594)

**v1.2 Configuration & Polish (2026-01-14):**

- 5 phases of configuration improvements (Phases 16-20)
- Fixed Phase2B timer interval bug
- Added baseline_rtt_bounds validation
- Deprecated legacy steering params with warnings
- Added 77 edge case tests (594 → 671)
- Enabled Phase2B confidence scoring in dry-run mode

**v1.3 Reliability & Hardening (2026-01-21):**

- 4 phases of safety and deployment improvements (Phases 21-24)
- REST-to-SSH failover with FailoverRouterClient
- Baseline freeze invariant tests, state corruption recovery
- Deployment validation script (423 lines)
- 54 new tests (671 → 725)

**v1.4 Observability (2026-01-24):**

- 2 phases of monitoring infrastructure (Phases 25-26)
- HTTP health endpoint for steering daemon on port 9102
- Live steering state exposure (confidence, congestion, decisions)
- Kubernetes-compatible health probes (200/503)
- 28 new tests (725 → 752)

**Next Steps:**

- Execute v1.5 Quality & Hygiene milestone

## Constraints

- **Production deployment**: Running in home network — must maintain stability and reliability
- **No breaking changes**: Existing configurations and APIs must continue to work
- **Python 3.12**: Runtime and tooling locked to this version
- **systemd integration**: Deployment pattern is fixed (service templates, timers)
- **Dual transport**: Must maintain both REST API (preferred) and SSH (fallback) support
- **No external monitoring**: Keep self-contained (no Prometheus, Sentry dependencies)
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing state files and configuration must remain compatible
