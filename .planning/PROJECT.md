# wanctl

## What This Is

wanctl is an adaptive CAKE bandwidth controller for MikroTik RouterOS that continuously monitors network latency and adjusts queue limits in real-time, with optional multi-WAN steering for latency-sensitive traffic.

## Core Value

Sub-second congestion detection with 50ms control loops, achieved through systematic performance optimization and code quality improvements while maintaining production reliability.

## Current Milestone: v1.11 WAN-Aware Steering

**Goal:** Feed autorate's end-to-end WAN RTT state into steering's failover decision, closing the gap where CAKE queue stats mask ISP-level congestion.

**Target features:**

- Steering reads autorate WAN congestion state (RED/YELLOW/GREEN) as additional failover signal
- Hysteresis gate: sustained WAN RED (~1s) triggers failover, sustained GREEN (~3s) for recovery
- Configurable thresholds in YAML for production tuning
- Existing CAKE stats remain primary signal; WAN state is secondary/amplifying
- Recovery: only new connections steer, existing connections expire naturally on ATT

### Active

**Ongoing:**

### Deferred

- [ ] SSH connection pooling — Low ROI, REST API already optimal
- [ ] CAKE stats caching — Not needed, flash wear protection working

### Out of Scope

- Machine learning-based bandwidth prediction — unnecessary complexity
- Full Prometheus/Grafana stack — designing compatible naming, but not requiring external deps
- Breaking changes to configuration format — maintain compatibility
- Support for non-RouterOS devices — focused on existing integration

## Constraints

- **Production deployment**: Running in home network — must maintain stability and reliability
- **No breaking changes**: Existing configurations and APIs must continue to work
- **Python 3.12**: Runtime and tooling locked to this version
- **systemd integration**: Deployment pattern is fixed (service templates, timers)
- **Dual transport**: Must maintain both REST API (preferred) and SSH (fallback) support
- **No external monitoring**: Keep self-contained (no Prometheus, Sentry dependencies)
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing state files and configuration must remain compatible
