| 30 | Security Audit | ✓ PASSED | 11/11 truths | 2026-01-24 |

**Score:** 4/4 phases (100%)

### Phase 27: Test Coverage Setup

**Deliverables:**
- pyproject.toml: [tool.coverage.*] configuration (14 lines)
- Makefile: coverage target with HTML generation
- README.md: Coverage badge (72%)
- .gitignore: Coverage artifact exclusions

**Verified:** pytest-cov configured, HTML reports generated, badge displays correctly.

### Phase 28: Codebase Cleanup

**Deliverables:**
- 28-CLEANUP-REPORT.md (218 lines)
- B007 fix in test_baseline_rtt_manager.py

**Verified:** All ruff checks pass, no dead code, no TODO markers, complexity documented.

### Phase 29: Documentation Verification

**Deliverables:**
- 6 files updated to version 1.4.0
- CONFIG_SCHEMA.md: 4 missing fields added
- AUDIT-REPORT.md (178 lines)

**Verified:** All version refs consistent, CLI examples work, config docs match code.

### Phase 30: Security Audit

**Deliverables:**
- pyproject.toml: 4 security tools + bandit config
- .secrets.baseline (150 lines)
- Makefile: 5 security targets
- 30-AUDIT-REPORT.md (247 lines)

**Verified:** Zero CVEs, zero real secrets, all scans pass, audit documented.

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|------------|------|----|----|
| pyproject.toml sections | Phase 27 [tool.coverage] | Phase 30 [tool.bandit] | ✓ NO CONFLICT |
| Makefile targets | Phase 27 coverage | Phase 30 security | ✓ NO CONFLICT |
| Dev dependencies | Phase 27 pytest-cov | Phase 30 security tools | ✓ NO CONFLICT |
| .gitignore entries | Phase 27 coverage | Phase 30 secrets baseline | ✓ NO CONFLICT |
| Version consistency | Phase 29 updates | All phases | ✓ CONSISTENT |
| TOML parsing | All sections | pyproject.toml | ✓ VALID |

**Score:** 18/18 connections (100%)

**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0
**Configuration conflicts:** 0

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Daily Workflow | Edit → make clean → make ci → commit | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Coverage Report | make coverage → view HTML → badge update | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Security Audit | make security → review findings → verify clean | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Doc Verification | Version check → docs match code → consistent | ✓ COMPLETE |

**Score:** 4/4 flows (100%)

## Anti-Patterns

None found across all phases:
- No TODO/FIXME comments in modified files
- No placeholder implementations
- No empty return stubs
- No console.log-only handlers

## Tech Debt

**Accumulated:** 1 item (intentional deferral)

| Phase | Item | Severity | Rationale |
|-------|------|----------|-----------|
| 27 | COV-04: No coverage threshold enforcement | Low | Plan explicitly states "measure first" — advisory baseline established at 72% |

**Assessment:** This is acceptable tech debt. The plan intentionally deferred threshold enforcement to establish a measurement baseline first. Future milestone can add `fail_under` configuration.

## Test Suite

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total tests | 747 |
| All passing | ✓ |
| Coverage | 72% |
| New tests this milestone | 0 (tooling focus) |

## Code Quality

- **Linting:** ruff passes (all checks)
- **Type checking:** mypy passes (36 source files)
- **Security:** Zero CVEs, zero real secrets
- **Licenses:** LGPL-2.1 (paramiko) documented as acceptable

## Deviations from Plan

**Phase 27:**
- COV-03: Used coverage-report/ instead of htmlcov/ (intentional plan decision)
- COV-04: Deferred threshold enforcement (per plan success criteria)

**Phase 28:**
- None — cleanup executed as planned

**Phase 29:**
- None — all 4 plans executed as designed

**Phase 30:**
- Added inline `# nosec` comments for 5 false positives (documented in audit report)

All deviations documented and justified in phase SUMMARYs.

## Production Readiness

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| Test coverage | ✓ Measured at 72%, reporting functional |
| Code quality | ✓ All lints pass, complexity documented |
| Documentation | ✓ All docs accurate for v1.4.0 |
| Security | ✓ Zero CVEs, scanning integrated |
| Tooling | ✓ make coverage + make security functional |

**Ready for production use.**

## Milestone Accomplishments

1. **Test Coverage Infrastructure:** pytest-cov configured, 72% baseline established, HTML reports, README badge
2. **Clean Codebase:** Zero dead code, zero TODO markers, complexity documented for 11 high-complexity functions
3. **Accurate Documentation:** Version 1.4.0 standardized across 6 files, config docs enhanced, 14 doc issues fixed
4. **Security Posture:** Zero CVEs, 4 security tools integrated, `make security` target (~12.5s scan time)

## Conclusion

Milestone v1.5 Quality & Hygiene is complete. 19/20 requirements satisfied (1 intentionally deferred). All 4 phases verified. All E2E flows working. Minimal tech debt. The quality infrastructure is production-ready.
