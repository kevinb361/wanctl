# Cross-AI Plan Review — Phase 221

## Codex Review

# Phase 221 Plan Review

## Summary

The plan set is well-structured and mostly aligned with the Phase 221 goal: read-only matrix execution, no threshold edits, no controller-path mutation, final closeout, and folded-todo disposition. The main issue is not intent, it is executability. Several plans assume a Phase 220 evidence layout and aggregator output schema that do not match the current repo. Most importantly, `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py` currently returns `per_cell` / `per_target` / `per_path` / `per_window`, not the rich `cells[]` schema Plan 03 expects, and it currently fails on the existing evidence root because it reads an invalid/null sidecar and a root-level summary `signal-sheet.json`. Until that is resolved, Phase 221 is HIGH risk.

---

## 221-01-PLAN.md

### Strengths

- Correctly lands SAFE-11 first, before evidence collection and reporting.
- Good choice to freeze Phase 220 scripts from Phase 221's point of view.
- Ledger-first design is useful for multi-session operator work.
- The plan catches its own earlier mistake and changes the rehearsal row from `3/3 complete` to `1/3 partial`.

### Concerns

- **HIGH:** BGP/path-change detection is wrong. The plan uses `mtr-post-*.txt` existence, but the wrapper always writes post-flight MTR at [scripts/phase220-target-path-matrix.sh:372](/home/kevin/projects/wanctl/scripts/phase220-target-path-matrix.sh:372). The real signal is `path_change_detected` in `phase220-cell.json`.
- **MEDIUM:** Must-haves still say the rehearsal row is pre-populated as `complete 3/3`, while the task action says `partial 1/3`. That contradiction will confuse execution.
- **MEDIUM:** Ledger row-count regex excludes hyphenated targets like `vultr-dallas`, so the 18-row acceptance check will fail.
- **LOW:** The mutation-boundary clone should preserve the useful Phase 220 source-wide checks, not just the three named test functions.

### Suggestions

- Use `phase220-cell.json["path_change_detected"]` for `mtr_post_flag` / BGP flagging.
- Normalize all plan text to `dallas__spectrum__daytime = 1/3 partial`.
- Replace cell-id regexes with something like `^\| [^|]+__[^|]+__[^|]+ \|`.
- Add an explicit acceptance check that Phase 220 scripts are frozen via committed, staged, and unstaged diff channels.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM.** The plan is directionally sound, but the BGP flag and validation regex issues need fixing before execution.

---

## 221-02-PLAN.md

### Strengths

- Good multi-session model: one ledger update per operator session.
- Correctly avoids running the aggregator mid-matrix, reducing data-driven stop risk.
- Matrix-fail criteria are explicit and tied back to D-09.
- Inline operator runbook is a good choice; keeping docs untouched respects SAFE-11.

### Concerns

- **HIGH:** Evidence discovery does not match the wrapper. The wrapper writes `RUN-*` directories with `RUN-*/phase220-cell.json`; Plan 02 counts `*__r*/signal-sheet.json`. Future runs will be missed unless another process copies them into canonical cell dirs.
- **HIGH:** Failure handling depends on `failure_reason` / `attempts_exceeded` fields, but the wrapper does not emit those. Failed attempts may leave no sidecar at all.
- **HIGH:** The plan deadlocks on "valid with footnote." D-09 allows `≤2` supplemental incomplete cells, but Plan 03 only fires when `completed_replicates == 54`.
- **MEDIUM:** Evidence durability is underspecified. If evidence dirs are not committed, closeout references are not reproducible. If they are committed, final allowlist checks must allow them.
- **MEDIUM:** `bgp-changed` as a primary status conflicts with completion status. A 3/3 cell with path drift should still be `complete` with a separate flag.

### Suggestions

- Reconcile from valid `RUN-*/phase220-cell.json` records where `schema_version == 1` and `cell_id` is non-null.
- Add a manual/sidecar failed-attempt log if D-08 retry exhaustion must be tracked.
- Make status one of `pending|partial|complete|incomplete`; keep `path_change_detected` as a separate boolean.
- Decide one policy: either all 54 are mandatory, or Plan 03 must accept a D-09 valid-with-footnote state below 54.
- Define whether raw evidence is committed, normalized into Phase 221, or explicitly external.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH.** This is the operational heart of the phase, and its evidence discovery does not match the actual wrapper output.

---

## 221-03-PLAN.md

### Strengths

- Good report shape: threshold citation, canonical/supplemental separation, per-axis rollup, decision trace, todo disposition, SAFE-11 status.
- Correctly treats historical p99 values as reportage, not verdict input.
- Good instinct to run the aggregator only once at closeout.

### Concerns

- **HIGH:** The expected JSON schema is not what the aggregator emits. Actual output returns keys like `per_cell`, `per_target`, `per_path`, and `matrix_verdict` at [scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:311](/home/kevin/projects/wanctl/scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:311), not `cells[]`, `thresholds`, `phase220_yaml_sha`, timestamps, p50/p95, MTR refs, or `decision_tree_trace`.
- **HIGH:** The aggregator currently fails on the live evidence root with `KeyError: 'p99_ms'`, because it scans every `**/phase220-cell.json` at [scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:499](/home/kevin/projects/wanctl/scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:499), including an invalid/null sidecar at [phase220-cell.json:2](/home/kevin/projects/wanctl/.planning/phases/220-matrix-runner-scope-a1/evidence/RUN-20260601T150527Z/phase220-cell.json:2).
- **HIGH:** BGP overlay can flip the final verdict, but Plan 04 requires `CLOSEOUT.md` verdict to equal JSON `matrix_verdict`. Those contracts conflict.
- **MEDIUM:** Synthesizing `decision_tree_trace` in Plan 03 reimplements verdict logic outside the aggregator. That weakens the "pure read" guarantee.
- **LOW:** The MATCHED/FAILED grep acceptance uses an escaped `\|` inside an ERE alternation and may not match as intended.

### Suggestions

- Add a pre-Phase-221 blocker: run the aggregator against current evidence and either repair it or normalize the evidence root before matrix execution.
- Change Plan 03 to read actual aggregator output plus raw sidecars/signal sheets, or update Phase 220 aggregator/schema under an explicit exception.
- Do not allow a markdown-only verdict flip. Either the final verdict equals aggregator output, or the JSON is amended with an explicit `final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay`.
- Replace decision-tree synthesis with a descriptive trace derived from existing aggregator fields, unless the aggregator is extended and tested.

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH.** As written, Plan 03 cannot produce the promised artifacts from the current aggregator output.

---

## 221-04-PLAN.md

### Strengths

- Todo disposition is clear and traceable.
- Closing on any verdict is the right operational choice given the close-with-prejudice rule.
- Two-commit flow for todo move then closeout SHA amendment is auditable.
- Final SAFE-11 plus hot-path test slice is appropriate.

### Concerns

- **MEDIUM:** `git mv` will not reliably create `.planning/todos/closed/`; run `mkdir -p` first.
- **HIGH:** Preflight requires `CLOSEOUT.md` verdict to match JSON `matrix_verdict`, but Plan 03 allows BGP overlay to change the final verdict.
- **MEDIUM:** `yaml.safe_dump` may reformat the whole frontmatter, not just append fields. That is probably acceptable, but it contradicts "historical content preserved" expectations.
- **MEDIUM:** One final verification command uses the YAML blob SHA as a commit range base; use the YAML `base_sha` field or the same resolver as the test.
- **MEDIUM:** Final diff allowlist must match the evidence durability decision from Plan 02.

### Suggestions

- Add `mkdir -p .planning/todos/closed` before `git mv`.
- Resolve the JSON/markdown verdict contract before Plan 04.
- Use targeted frontmatter insertion if minimizing churn matters.
- Make final diff checks call the same base-SHA resolver used by `tests/test_phase221_mutation_boundary.py`.

### Risk Assessment

**MEDIUM-HIGH.** The todo mechanics are good, but they depend on Plan 03 producing a consistent closeout verdict.

---

## Overall Risk Assessment

**HIGH until corrected.** The phase is read-only and low operational risk to the controller, but high execution risk because the plans do not currently line up with the actual Phase 220 wrapper/evidence/aggregator surfaces. Fix the evidence indexing, BGP flag semantics, incomplete-cell readiness rule, and aggregator schema/runtime failure first. After that, the plan set drops to **MEDIUM/LOW** because the remaining work is documentation, ledger maintenance, and todo disposition.

---

## Consensus Summary

Only one reviewer (Codex) was invoked for this phase, so consensus is single-reviewer. The findings should still be treated as authoritative for planning iteration because they are grounded in direct file inspection of the actual Phase 220 wrapper, evidence sidecars, and aggregator code.

### Agreed Strengths

- SAFE-11 mutation-boundary landed early before evidence collection (Plan 01).
- Ledger-first multi-session operator model (Plans 01–02).
- Aggregator runs once at closeout, not per cell (Plan 02 → Plan 03).
- Two-commit closeout audit trail with hot-path test slice (Plan 04).
- Read-only posture and close-with-prejudice operational stance hold across all four plans.

### Agreed Concerns (single-reviewer, but high confidence)

- **HIGH — Evidence layout mismatch:** Plan 02's discovery logic (`*__r*/signal-sheet.json`) does not match the wrapper's actual output (`RUN-*/phase220-cell.json`). This blocks accurate ledger reconciliation.
- **HIGH — BGP/path-change detection logic:** Plan 01 uses `mtr-post-*.txt` existence; the real signal is `phase220-cell.json["path_change_detected"]`.
- **HIGH — Aggregator schema drift:** Plan 03 expects a `cells[]` rich schema; the actual aggregator emits `per_cell` / `per_target` / `per_path` / `matrix_verdict`. Plan 03 cannot produce its promised artifacts as written.
- **HIGH — Aggregator runtime failure:** Aggregator KeyErrors on the live evidence root due to an invalid/null sidecar at `RUN-20260601T150527Z/phase220-cell.json`. Must be repaired or evidence root normalized before Phase 221 runs.
- **HIGH — Verdict contract conflict:** Plan 03 allows BGP overlay to flip the markdown verdict; Plan 04 preflight requires CLOSEOUT.md verdict == JSON `matrix_verdict`. Contracts are mutually inconsistent.
- **HIGH — Incomplete-cell readiness rule:** Plan 02 deadlocks because D-09 allows ≤2 supplemental incomplete cells while Plan 03 only triggers at `completed_replicates == 54`.
- **MEDIUM — Ledger regex excludes hyphenated targets** (`vultr-dallas`); the 18-row acceptance check will fail.
- **MEDIUM — Rehearsal row contradiction:** Plan 01 must-haves say `complete 3/3`, task action says `partial 1/3`.
- **MEDIUM — Evidence durability underspecified:** Need an explicit decision on whether raw evidence is committed, normalized into Phase 221, or external — and the final-diff allowlist must match.
- **MEDIUM — Decision-tree trace synthesized outside aggregator** weakens the "pure read" guarantee.

### Divergent Views

None — only one reviewer.

### Recommended Next Step

Open a planning iteration (`/gsd:plan-phase 221 --reviews`) to:

1. Decide aggregator strategy: either (a) extend `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py` under an explicit exception to produce the Plan 03 schema, or (b) rewrite Plan 03 to consume the existing `per_cell` / `per_target` / `per_path` shape plus raw sidecars.
2. Repair or skip the invalid `RUN-20260601T150527Z/phase220-cell.json` so the aggregator stops KeyError'ing.
3. Switch BGP flag derivation in Plan 01 to `path_change_detected` from `phase220-cell.json`.
4. Update Plan 02 evidence discovery to `RUN-*/phase220-cell.json` with `schema_version == 1` filter.
5. Reconcile the verdict contract: pick one of (a) JSON is final and markdown mirrors it, or (b) markdown is final and JSON is amended with `final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay`. Apply consistently across Plans 03 and 04.
6. Resolve the D-09 vs `==54` readiness deadlock — decide whether Plan 03 accepts a valid-with-footnote state.
7. Fix the ledger row regex and the `complete 3/3` vs `partial 1/3` contradiction in Plan 01.
8. Specify evidence durability and align the final-diff allowlist in Plan 04.

# Cross-AI Plan Review — Phase 221 (Cycle 2)

- reviewers: [codex]
- reviewed_at: 2026-06-01T16:57:03Z
- replan_commit: 66a8d78
- plans_reviewed: [221-01-PLAN.md, 221-02-PLAN.md, 221-03-PLAN.md, 221-04-PLAN.md]
- prior_cycle: cycle 1 raised 8 HIGHs (see above)

## Codex Review (Cycle 2)

**Summary**
Cycle 2 fixes several of the original shape mismatches, but it is not ready to execute. I would not run these plans yet.

Main blockers: Plan 03 still mismatches the actual aggregator schema, the curated symlink evidence root will not be traversed by the aggregator, Plan 02 double-counts duplicate sidecars, and the new Phase 221 mutation-boundary base-SHA chain will fail unless a phase-start marker commit exists first.

**Cycle 1 HIGH Disposition**

1. **Plan 01 BGP detection signal**: **FULLY RESOLVED**
   Plans now consistently use `phase220-cell.json["path_change_detected"]`, not `mtr-post-*` existence. This matches `scripts/phase220-target-path-matrix.sh`, which always writes `mtr-post-*`.

2. **Plan 02 evidence discovery glob mismatch**: **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
   Discovery now targets `**/phase220-cell.json` and filters `schema_version == 1`, which matches the wrapper better. But it groups duplicate valid sidecars without deduping `(cell_id, run_dir)`. Current evidence has two manifests for the same replicate: `RUN-20260601T153405Z/...` and `dallas__spectrum__daytime__r1/...`.

3. **Plan 02 failure handling assumed nonexistent fields**: **FULLY RESOLVED**
   The replan now explicitly uses operator-maintained `attempts:<N>` ledger annotations because hard failures emit no sidecar. That is acceptable for an operator-driven plan.

4. **Plan 02 / Plan 03 D-09 readiness deadlock**: **FULLY RESOLVED**
   Readiness now allows `canonical_complete == 6` with `supplemental_incomplete <= 2`, instead of requiring raw `completed_replicates == 54`.

5. **Plan 03 aggregator schema mismatch**: **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
   The plan fixed the big `cells[]` vs `per_cell` mismatch, but still expects wrong fields:
   - Actual per-cell verdict key is `verdict`, not `cell_verdict`.
   - Actual `orthogonal_corroboration` keys are `path_orthogonal`, `target_orthogonal`, `driver_orthogonal`, `satisfied`, not `*_corroborated`.

6. **Plan 03 aggregator KeyError on live evidence root**: **PARTIALLY RESOLVED**
   Quarantining invalid sidecars is the right idea. But Plan 03's symlink snapshot does not work with the aggregator's `Path.glob("**/phase220-cell.json")`; reviewer's curated symlink test produced an empty `per_cell` dict. The KeyError is avoided, but by feeding the aggregator no records.

7. **Plan 03/04 verdict contract conflict**: **FULLY RESOLVED mechanically**
   The markdown verdict now must equal `JSON.matrix_verdict`, and Plan 04 checks that. However, this introduces a new semantic HIGH below because it drops the D-10 BGP exclusion from verdict effect.

8. **Plan 04 preflight equality conflict**: **FULLY RESOLVED**
   Same as above: equality is now explicit and verified.

**New Concerns (Cycle 2)**

- **HIGH: Phase 221 mutation-boundary test likely fails immediately.**
  There is no `docs(phase-221): begin phase execution` marker commit in git log. The resolver falls back to `scripts/phase220-matrix.yaml` `base_sha` (`50f3d...`). From that SHA to HEAD, `scripts/phase220-*` and `docs/PHASE220-MATRIX-RUNNER.md` already differ, so `test_no_phase220_scripts_diff` / final diff checks will fail unless the plan creates or requires a Phase 221 start marker before running the test.

- **HIGH: Plan 02 overcounts duplicate valid sidecars.** (extends cycle-1 HIGH #2)
  Current evidence has two valid `dallas__spectrum__daytime__r1` manifests with the same `run_dir`. Plan 02 counts manifests, not unique `(cell_id, replicate_index, run_dir)`. That can turn one real replicate into `2/3` and can prematurely latch readiness.

- **HIGH: Plan 03 curated symlink root is not traversed.** (extends cycle-1 HIGH #6)
  The aggregator uses `evidence_root.glob("**/phase220-cell.json")`; in practice it did not recurse into symlinked directories. The dry run can exit 0 with zero records, and the real run will fail later or produce useless output.

- **HIGH: Plan 03 still names aggregator fields incorrectly.** (extends cycle-1 HIGH #5)
  Update the plan to use per-cell `verdict` and `orthogonal_corroboration.{path_orthogonal,target_orthogonal,driver_orthogonal,satisfied}`.

- **HIGH: BGP handling now violates CONTEXT D-10.** (new semantic regression introduced by the verdict-contract fix)
  D-10 says BGP-flagged `cell_defect` cells are excluded from defect-corroboration arguments. Cycle 2 makes BGP a caveat only and keeps the aggregator verdict unchanged. That can allow `defect_located` based on path-ambiguous cells.

- **MEDIUM: Evidence durability remains local-only.**
  The plan explicitly does not commit raw evidence. That may be acceptable, but the closeout report will cite paths and hashes into local Phase 220 evidence. This should be called out as an audit limitation.

**Overall Risk Assessment**
Still **HIGH**. The intent is better than Cycle 1, but execution will likely fail before closeout, and there is one semantic regression around BGP exclusion.

**Verdict**
**needs-another-replan-cycle**

## Consensus Summary (Cycle 2)

Only Codex was invoked this cycle, so consensus is single-reviewer; findings are grounded in direct file inspection of the aggregator code, wrapper script, and live evidence.

### Cycle 1 HIGH Disposition (rollup)

- FULLY RESOLVED: 5 (BGP signal, failure-handling fields, D-09 deadlock, verdict-contract conflict, preflight equality)
- PARTIALLY RESOLVED: 3 (evidence discovery deduplication, aggregator schema field names, aggregator KeyError via symlink farm)
- UNRESOLVED: 0

### Current HIGH Concerns (5 unresolved)

1. **Phase 221 base-SHA marker missing** — mutation-boundary test will likely fail on first commit because `docs(phase-221): begin phase execution` does not exist; resolver falls back to Phase 220 base_sha against which Phase 220 scripts already differ.
2. **Plan 02 sidecar dedup gap** — duplicate manifests for the same `(cell_id, run_dir)` are counted as separate replicates; can over-credit a cell to 2/3 and prematurely latch Plan 03 readiness.
3. **Plan 03 symlink curated-root not traversed** — aggregator's `Path.glob("**/phase220-cell.json")` does not recurse into symlinked dirs; the dry-run gate produces empty `per_cell` instead of catching real problems.
4. **Plan 03 aggregator field names still wrong** — `cell_verdict` should be `verdict`; `*_corroborated` should be `path_orthogonal`/`target_orthogonal`/`driver_orthogonal`/`satisfied`.
5. **BGP handling violates CONTEXT D-10** — making BGP a caveat-only (no verdict effect) drops the D-10 requirement to exclude BGP-flagged defect cells from defect-corroboration; can allow path-ambiguous `defect_located`.

### Recommended Next Step

Replan again:
1. Add a Plan 0 (or Plan 01 task) that lands a `docs(phase-221): begin phase execution` marker commit BEFORE the mutation-boundary test runs, so `resolve_phase221_base_sha()` resolves to a commit after the existing Phase 220 script churn.
2. Plan 02: dedup by `(base_cell_id, replicate_index, run_dir)` tuple; explicitly handle the rehearsal + RUN-* duplicate.
3. Plan 03: replace the symlink snapshot with either (a) a copy-tree (cp -r --dereference) or (b) a YAML-list-based aggregator allowlist (out of SAFE-11 scope) or (c) prune invalid sidecars in-place via an operator step.
4. Plan 03: fix field-name expectations and acceptance checks to match `verdict` and the four orthogonal_corroboration keys.
5. Decide BGP policy: either restore D-10 exclusion (aggregator JSON gets a `final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay` field; CLOSEOUT.md mirrors that) OR explicitly amend CONTEXT D-10 to caveat-only.

# Cross-AI Plan Review — Phase 221 (Cycle 3)

- reviewers: [codex]
- reviewed_at: 2026-06-01T17:18:33Z
- replan_commit: bdd9e6e
- plans_reviewed: [221-01-PLAN.md, 221-02-PLAN.md, 221-03-PLAN.md, 221-04-PLAN.md]
- prior_cycle: cycle 2 raised 5 HIGHs (see above)

## Codex Review (Cycle 3)

**Summary**

Cycle 3 is better grounded in the actual Phase 220 files, but it is not ready. It closes the schema-name mistakes and mostly fixes current-evidence dedup, but the marker commit procedure is executable-broken, the BGP overlay contract is internally contradictory, and the curated evidence copy now has a real symlink/escape problem.

**Cycle-2 HIGH Disposition**

| # | Disposition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Phase 221 base-SHA marker missing | **UNRESOLVED** | Plan 01 adds the right marker requirement at `221-01-PLAN.md:137`, but the shell guard at `221-01-PLAN.md:145` exits even when the marker is absent because `(test -z ... || echo ...) && exit 0` always reaches `exit 0`. Current `git log` has no Phase 221 marker. |
| 2. Plan 02 sidecar dedup over-count | **FULLY RESOLVED for current evidence** | Plan 02 dedups on `(base_cell_id, replicate_index, run_dir_canonical)` at `221-02-PLAN.md:211`. Current duplicate manifests both have `cell_id: dallas__spectrum__daytime__r1` and same `run_dir`. |
| 3. Curated symlink not traversed | **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** | Plan 03 replaces symlink farm with real copied dirs at `221-03-PLAN.md:255` and `:269`. That fixes traversal, but `--dereference` follows internal symlinks outside the evidence root, and current evidence has `flent -> /home/kevin/flent-results/...`. Manifests keep `run_dir` pointing back to live evidence, and the aggregator reads `run_dir/.../signal-sheet.json` first at `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:452`. |
| 4. Aggregator field names wrong | **FULLY RESOLVED** | Plan 03 now names `per_cell`, `verdict`, and `path_orthogonal/target_orthogonal/driver_orthogonal/satisfied` at `221-03-PLAN.md:23`. Matches actual aggregator output at `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:311` and per-cell `verdict` assignment at `:243`. |
| 5. BGP/D-10 exclusion | **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** | Plan 03 adds overlay fields and final verdict at `221-03-PLAN.md:25`, but the same plan still says "no BGP-overlay verdict flip" at `:61`, verifies `MD.verdict == j['matrix_verdict']` at `:766`, and marks done as "BGP caveat reported but does NOT flip verdict" at `:768`. |

**New Concerns (Cycle 3)**

- **HIGH:** Plan 01 marker command will not create the marker commit. The shell guard `(test -z ... || echo ...) && exit 0` always reaches `exit 0` regardless of marker presence. Fix the control flow before execution.

- **HIGH:** `cp -r --dereference` is not safe here. It will follow current evidence symlinks under `RUN-*/spectrum/tcp_12down/flent` to `/home/kevin/flent-results/...`, escaping the curated root. Use a bounded copier that copies only required files, rejects escaping symlinks, and rewrites copied `phase220-cell.json` `run_dir` to the snapshot path.

- **HIGH:** BGP overlay recomputes the locked matrix verdict with hand-copied logic that is not equivalent to the aggregator. Aggregator control p99 is overwritten by canonical cells per window at `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:236`; the overlay counts any canonical cell under threshold at `221-03-PLAN.md:479`. That can change verdicts even when `bgp_excluded_cells` is empty.

- **MEDIUM:** `mtr_post_flag` uses only the latest replicate at `221-02-PLAN.md:228` and `221-03-PLAN.md:419`. D-10 should exclude a defect cell if any contributing replicate has `path_change_detected: true`.

- **MEDIUM:** Dedup is sufficient for the current duplicate, but not for a valid re-run of the same replicate index in a different `run_dir`. Counting should collapse by `(base_cell_id, replicate_index)` for credit, with `run_dir` retained only for audit.

**Suggestions**

- Replace Task 0 guard with an explicit `if marker_exists; then skip; else git commit --allow-empty ...; fi`.
- Build curated evidence using Python: validate sidecars, choose winner manifests, copy only `phase220-cell.json`, `signal-sheet.json`, `mtr-pre/post`, and needed nested signal sheets; reject symlinks whose resolved target is outside the evidence root.
- Do not hand-copy aggregator verdict logic. Import `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py` read-only and call `matrix_verdict()` on `per_cell minus bgp_excluded_cells`.
- Add a hard assertion: if `bgp_excluded_cells == []`, then `final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay == matrix_verdict`.
- Remove all stale Plan 03 text and verifiers that still bind §1 to raw `matrix_verdict`.

**Overall Risk Assessment**

**HIGH.** The marker base-SHA fix currently will not execute, and the BGP overlay can produce a non-Phase-220 verdict while claiming to apply the locked algorithm. The symlink dereference issue is also unsafe enough to block execution.

**Verdict**

**needs-another-replan-cycle**

## Consensus Summary (Cycle 3)

Only Codex was invoked this cycle, so consensus is single-reviewer; findings are grounded in direct file inspection of the aggregator code, wrapper script, and live evidence.

### Cycle 2 HIGH Disposition (rollup)

- FULLY RESOLVED: 1 (aggregator field names)
- FULLY RESOLVED for current evidence: 1 (Plan 02 sidecar dedup — works for present duplicates; weakness flagged for re-runs)
- PARTIALLY RESOLVED: 2 (curated symlink traversal — copy approach works but unsafe; BGP/D-10 exclusion — overlay fields added but contract still says no flip)
- UNRESOLVED: 1 (Phase 221 base-SHA marker — shell guard logic broken)

### Current HIGH Concerns (3 unresolved)

1. **Phase 221 marker commit guard is broken** — Plan 01 Task 0 shell control flow `(test -z ... || echo ...) && exit 0` always succeeds and skips the `git commit --allow-empty` step, so the marker is never created and the mutation-boundary base-SHA falls through to Phase 220.
2. **`cp -r --dereference` follows symlinks outside the curated evidence root** — current evidence has `flent -> /home/kevin/flent-results/...`; deref copy will escape the snapshot scope and inflate it with unrelated data. Need a bounded copier that rejects escaping symlinks and rewrites `run_dir` fields.
3. **BGP overlay reimplements verdict logic divergently from the aggregator** — overlay applies per-cell threshold counting that differs from the aggregator's per-window canonical-control p99 override; can change the verdict even when `bgp_excluded_cells == []`. Also, Plan 03 has contradictory text: adds overlay fields/final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay but still asserts `MD.verdict == j['matrix_verdict']` and says "BGP caveat reported but does NOT flip verdict."

### Recommended Next Step

Replan again:
1. Plan 01 Task 0: rewrite the marker guard as `if ! git log --grep='^docs(phase-221): begin phase execution' --pretty=%H | grep -q .; then git commit --allow-empty -m 'docs(phase-221): begin phase execution'; fi`. Add an acceptance check that `git log --grep=...` resolves to a single commit BEFORE the mutation-boundary test runs.
2. Plan 03: replace `cp -r --dereference` with a Python builder that (a) validates each sidecar, (b) copies only `phase220-cell.json`, `signal-sheet.json`, `mtr-pre/post`, and required nested signal sheets, (c) rejects symlinks whose `Path.resolve()` escapes the evidence root, (d) rewrites copied `phase220-cell.json["run_dir"]` to the snapshot path so the aggregator's `signal-sheet.json` lookup stays inside the curated tree.
3. Plan 03: pick one BGP contract and apply it everywhere. Either (a) call `matrix_verdict()` from `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py` with `bgp_excluded_cells` removed from `per_cell` (single source of truth), or (b) keep the markdown-only caveat and drop all `final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay` schema. Add an invariant assertion `bgp_excluded_cells == [] → final_verdict == matrix_verdict`.
4. Plan 02 + Plan 03: change `mtr_post_flag` derivation to OR across all contributing replicates (any replicate with `path_change_detected: true` flags the cell), not just the latest replicate.
5. Plan 02: change dedup credit to `(base_cell_id, replicate_index)` collapse with `run_dir` retained for audit only, so future legitimate re-runs of the same replicate slot don't double-count.

## Codex Review (Cycle 4)

**Summary**

Cycle 4 lands the three structural fixes Cycle 3 asked for: the marker-commit guard is now explicit `if/then/else/fi` with a post-create SHA self-test, the curated evidence copier is a bounded Python builder that rejects escaping symlinks and rewrites copied `phase220-cell.json["run_dir"]`, and the BGP overlay now imports and reuses the aggregator's `matrix_verdict()` / `load_matrix_definition()` as the single source of truth. However, one structural leak remains: Plan 03 §10 Todo Disposition and the closeout-commit message still key off raw `<matrix_verdict>` instead of `<final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay>`. That is the exact "raw-vs-post-overlay verdict can diverge" defect class Cycle 3 was trying to eliminate, and it is the only remaining HIGH.

**Cycle-3 HIGH Disposition**

| # | Cycle-3 HIGH | Disposition | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Marker commit guard broken | **FULLY RESOLVED at plan level** | Plan 01 now uses explicit `if ...; then ...; else git commit --allow-empty ...; fi` and a post-create SHA self-test asserting marker reachable from HEAD: `221-01-PLAN.md:148`, `221-01-PLAN.md:163`. Live `git log` at `b5a7dc9` still has no marker (expected — Task 0 lands it at execution time). |
| 2 | `cp -r --dereference` symlink escape + stale `run_dir` | **FULLY RESOLVED** | Plan 03 replaces dereference copy with a bounded Python copier that rejects symlinks escaping `SOURCE_ROOT` (`221-03-PLAN.md:425`) and rewrites copied manifest `run_dir` to the snapshot path (`221-03-PLAN.md:456`). Matches aggregator's manifest-driven signal-sheet lookup at `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:452`. Live evidence confirms external `flent -> /home/kevin/flent-results/...` symlinks exist, so the bounded copier is necessary. |
| 3 | BGP overlay divergent / contradictory | **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** | Core overlay logic is correct: Plan 03 imports the aggregator and calls `matrix_verdict()` directly (`221-03-PLAN.md:602`, `:642`); aggregator at `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:228` is the real source of truth. But Plan 03 §10 Todo Disposition (`221-03-PLAN.md:884`, `:888`) and the closeout-commit message (`221-03-PLAN.md:915`) still substitute raw `<matrix_verdict>` instead of `<final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay>`. Plan 04 enforces markdown verdict equality against the JSON final, but §10 in markdown is still bound to the raw value, so conditional CRITERIA-02 inclusion can key off the wrong verdict when D-10 flips it. |

**Per-Plan Strengths**

| Plan | Strengths |
|---|---|
| 221-01 | Marker guard is executable. Phase 221 base-SHA resolver and Phase 220 script-freeze gates are explicit: `221-01-PLAN.md:224`, `:230`. |
| 221-02 | Discovery matches real wrapper output. Quarantines invalid sidecars. Dedups by `(base_cell_id, replicate_index)` collapse with `run_dir` retained as audit. ORs `path_change_detected` across replicates: `221-02-PLAN.md:212`, `:214`, `:232`. |
| 221-03 | Plan reflects actual aggregator schema: per-cell dict, per-cell `verdict`, four `orthogonal_corroboration.*` keys: matches `scripts/phase220-matrix-aggregator.py:311`. Bounded copy plus aggregator-as-library overlay are the correct shape. |
| 221-04 | Todo closure mechanics improved: `mkdir -p`, `git mv`, targeted frontmatter insertion, final SAFE-11 invocation via shared base-SHA resolver: `221-04-PLAN.md:186`, `:222`, `:432`. |

**New Concerns (Cycle 4)**

| Severity | Plan | Finding |
|---|---|---|
| **HIGH** | 221-03 | §10 Todo Disposition and closeout-commit message still key off raw `<matrix_verdict>`, not `<final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay>`. If D-10 flips the verdict, §10 reports the wrong verdict and the conditional CRITERIA-02 carry block can be omitted or wrongly included. References: `221-03-PLAN.md:884`, `:888`, `:915`. |
| **MEDIUM** | 221-01 | Empty-marker acceptance check looks fragile: `git log --format=%H --name-only \| tail -1` returns the marker commit's hash on an empty commit, not a zero-changed-files signal — likely a false negative. Suggested replacement: `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r "$MARKER_SHA" \| wc -l` must equal 0. Reference: `221-01-PLAN.md:180`. |
| **MEDIUM** | 221-02 / 221-03 | `duplicate_sidecars` schema is ambiguous between plans. Plan 02 records `run_dir_canonical` per audit entry (`221-02-PLAN.md:218`); Plan 03 treats each entry as a string path with `Path(p).parent` (`221-03-PLAN.md:389`). Either standardize on `list[str]` or `list[dict]` and update both. |
| **MEDIUM** | 221-03 | Acceptance check greps for `"BGP Caveat"` but the planned §7 header is `"BGP Overlay"` — the check can fail despite correct content. References: `221-03-PLAN.md:823`, `:931`. |
| **LOW** | 221-02 / 221-03 | Some prose still describes `mtr_post_flag` as the latest-replicate value while executable logic does OR-across-replicates — purge stale text. References: `221-02-PLAN.md:355`, `221-03-PLAN.md:300`. |

**Suggestions**

- Plan 03: replace every `<matrix_verdict>` placeholder in §10 and the closeout-commit-message template with `<final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay>`. Conditional CRITERIA-02 inclusion must key off the post-overlay value.
- Plan 01: replace the empty-marker acceptance check with `git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-only -r "$MARKER_SHA" \| wc -l \| grep -q '^0$'`.
- Plans 02/03: define `duplicate_sidecars` as a single concrete schema (recommend `list[str]` for simplicity) and align both plans.
- Plan 03: rename the §7 BGP section consistently across the plan and acceptance grep, OR widen the grep to `BGP Overlay\|BGP-Change Footnote\|BGP Caveat`.
- Plans 02/03: scrub remaining "latest replicate" wording for `mtr_post_flag` derivation.

**Overall Risk Assessment**

**HIGH.** Three Cycle-3 structural fixes landed cleanly. The remaining HIGH is narrow but operationally consequential — the §10 verdict-source leak can publish the wrong todo-disposition verdict in exactly the corner case (D-10 BGP overlay flips matrix verdict) the new overlay machinery was built to handle correctly. The MEDIUMs are mechanical execution-risk issues (acceptance grep false-negatives, schema drift between plans) that can compound under operator fatigue but are not blocking by themselves.

## Consensus Summary (Cycle 4)

Only Codex was invoked this cycle, so consensus is single-reviewer; findings are grounded in direct file inspection of the aggregator code, wrapper script, live evidence symlinks, and live `git log`.

### Cycle 3 HIGH Disposition (rollup)

- FULLY RESOLVED: 2 (marker-commit guard at plan level, bounded copier with manifest run_dir rewrite)
- PARTIALLY RESOLVED: 1 (BGP overlay — core overlay correctly uses aggregator as library; §10 Todo Disposition + closeout-commit message still reference raw `matrix_verdict` instead of `final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay`)
- UNRESOLVED: 0

### Current HIGH Concerns (1 unresolved)

1. **Plan 03 §10 + closeout commit message still cite raw `matrix_verdict`** — When D-10 BGP overlay flips the verdict, §10 Todo Disposition publishes the pre-overlay value and the conditional CRITERIA-02 close-with-prejudice carry block can be wrongly omitted or wrongly included. Plan 04 enforces markdown==JSON final equality on §1, but §10's verdict substitution is bound to the raw aggregator output. References: `221-03-PLAN.md:884`, `:888`, `:915`.

### Recommended Next Step

Replan once more (targeted, low-churn):

1. Plan 03: replace `<matrix_verdict>` with `<final_verdict_after_bgp_overlay>` in §10 verdict substitution and in the closeout-commit-message template; gate conditional CRITERIA-02 inclusion on the post-overlay value.
2. Plan 01: replace the empty-marker acceptance check with `git diff-tree` zero-changed-files form to remove the false-negative risk.
3. Plans 02/03: align `duplicate_sidecars` schema to a single concrete type and update consumers.
4. Plan 03: reconcile §7 BGP-section header naming with the acceptance grep.
5. Plans 02/03: remove remaining "latest replicate" `mtr_post_flag` prose.
