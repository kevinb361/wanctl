# Phase 3 Plan 2: Final Documentation and Milestone Completion

**Phase:** 03-production-finalization
**Plan:** 02
**Status:** Ready for execution
**Created:** 2026-01-13

---

## Objective

Complete the optimization milestone by updating final documentation, marking Phase 3 complete, and ensuring all artifacts properly document the 40x performance improvement achieved (2s → 50ms).

## Context

Phase 2 and Phase 3 Plan 01 complete:
- 50ms interval finalized as production standard
- All configuration verified and documented
- PRODUCTION_INTERVAL.md created with comprehensive guidance
- Code comments updated to reflect production status

Remaining work:
- Update CHANGELOG.md with Phase 2/3 accomplishments
- Mark Phase 3 complete in ROADMAP.md
- Update STATE.md to reflect milestone completion
- Verify all documentation is consistent

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with optimization accomplishments
- [ ] ROADMAP.md marks Phase 3 complete
- [ ] STATE.md reflects milestone completion
- [ ] All references to speed improvement use "40x" (not "20x")
- [ ] Project documentation complete and consistent

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update CHANGELOG

Update `CHANGELOG.md` with Phase 2 and Phase 3 accomplishments:

**Add section for optimization milestone:**
- 50ms interval optimization (40x speed improvement)
- Phase 2 testing results (250ms, 50ms validation)
- Phase 3 production finalization
- RRUL stress test results
- Performance metrics (0% idle CPU, 45% peak under load)
- Documentation additions (PRODUCTION_INTERVAL.md, test summaries)

**Expected files:**
- Modify: `CHANGELOG.md`

**Commit:** `docs(03-02): update changelog with optimization milestone`

### Task 2: Mark Phase 3 Complete

Update ROADMAP.md to mark Phase 3 complete:

**Changes:**
- Phase 3 status: "In progress" → "✓ Complete"
- Phase 3 plans: "1/2" → "2/2"
- Completion date: 2026-01-13
- Update focus statement to reflect milestone completion

**Expected files:**
- Modify: `.planning/ROADMAP.md`

**Commit:** None (deferred to plan metadata commit)

### Task 3: Update Final State

Update STATE.md to reflect milestone completion:

**Changes:**
- Current position: Phase 3 complete
- Progress: 90% → 100%
- Phase 3 summary: Mark complete with plan 03-02 details
- Session continuity: Milestone complete
- Performance metrics: Final values

**Expected files:**
- Modify: `.planning/STATE.md`

**Commit:** None (deferred to plan metadata commit)

### Task 4: Verify Documentation Consistency

Quick verification that all documentation is consistent:

**Check:**
- All speed references use "40x" (not "20x")
- All baseline references use "2s" (not "1s")
- README.md reflects current state
- PRODUCTION_INTERVAL.md is accurate
- Phase summaries are complete

**Action:** Document verification results in plan summary

**Commit:** None (verification only)

## Dependencies

**Requires:**
- Plan 03-01 complete (production interval finalized)
- All Phase 2 testing complete

**Blocks:**
- None (final plan in milestone)

## Validation

**After Task 1:**
- CHANGELOG.md has comprehensive optimization section

**After Task 2:**
- ROADMAP.md shows Phase 3 complete

**After Task 3:**
- STATE.md shows 100% progress, milestone complete

**After Task 4:**
- All documentation consistent and accurate

## Risks

**None:** Pure documentation task, no code changes or deployments.

## Notes

- This completes the optimization milestone
- Original goal: <2s cycle latency → Achieved: 50ms (40x faster)
- Router CPU impact: 0% at idle (better than expected)
- All testing validated, production-ready

**Plan Type:** Documentation cleanup
**Estimated Scope:** Small (documentation only)
