# Roadmap: wanctl

## Milestones

- ✅ **v1.53 Pluggable RTT Measurement Backend** — shipped 2026-06-19 (Phases 238–246; 26/26 REQs; `RttBackend` seam behind icmplib default, `fping` implemented/selectable, live A/B verdict `rollback_trigger / keep-icmplib`, production stayed on icmplib, SAFE-17 held) — `milestones/v1.53-ROADMAP.md`
- 📌 **Pipeline: WAN route ownership / Netwatch retirement** — pending high-priority follow-up: make exactly one component own WAN route mutation before enabling wanctl route failover; Netwatch remains interim owner until wanctl route ownership is designed, tested, canaried, and operator-approved — `.planning/todos/pending/2026-06-18-route-ownership-netwatch-to-wanctl-failover.md`
- ✅ **v1.52 Silicom Bypass Operationalization** — shipped 2026-06-14 (Phases 235–237; 15/15 REQs; guarded bypass CLI + boot baseline, two-mode watchdog fail-open, HIL harness, standalone deploy ownership, SAFE-16 held — 10th consecutive zero-controller-diff milestone) — `milestones/v1.52-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.51 Post-Migration Consolidation** — shipped 2026-06-12 (Phases 232–234; 10/10 REQs; BOUND-01 cleanup guard fail-closed, gated repo sweep, planning-metadata reconciliation, SAFE-15 held — 9th consecutive zero-controller-diff milestone) — `milestones/v1.51-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.50 cake-autorate Migration Hardening** — shipped 2026-06-10 (Phases 229–231; 10/10 REQs, audit passed; ATT deploy/test/monitor parity, both-WAN migration-held PASS, rollback provable, SAFE-14 held) — `milestones/v1.50-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.49 Spectrum DSCP Tinning Re-evaluation** — closed 2026-06-09 overtaken-by-events (Phases 225–227 complete; Phase 228 verdict unexecuted — production migrated both WANs to cake-autorate before it ran) — `milestones/v1.49-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.48 Steering Runtime Drift Closure** — shipped 2026-06-03 (Phases 222–224; live steering daemon aligned `1.39 → 1.47` in production, canary kept_aligned, SAFE-12 held) — `milestones/v1.48-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.47 Measurement Evidence Closure** — shipped 2026-06-02 (Phases 219–221; 18/18 REQs satisfied; `tcp_12down` closed-with-prejudice per CRITERIA-02) — `milestones/v1.47-ROADMAP.md`

- ✅ **v1.42 DOCSIS-Aware UL Congestion Control** — shipped 2026-05-06 — `milestones/v1.42-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.41 Per-Direction Control Surfaces** — closed 2026-05-04 (gaps_found) — `milestones/v1.41-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.40 Queue-Primary Signal Arbitration** — shipped 2026-05-03 — `milestones/v1.40-ROADMAP.md`
- ✅ **v1.39 Control-Path Timing & Measurement Accounting** — shipped 2026-04-24 (operator waiver; archived 2026-05-06 gaps_found) — `milestones/v1.39-ROADMAP.md`
- 📁 **v1.0 — v1.38** — see `MILESTONES.md` for the full historical index

> **Production controller state (2026-06-10):** Both WANs run upstream cake-autorate with wanctl state bridges (`cake-autorate-{spectrum,att}.service` + `-state-bridge.service`, live since 2026-06-08); `wanctl@{spectrum,att}` disabled as the **verified** rollback path (v1.50 SOAK-02 provable path, both-WAN preflight `overall_pass: true`). Steering consumes bridge-written state. Native wanctl remains the MikroTik/RouterOS controller and the portable default. Repo is the drift-proof source of truth for both WANs' artifact sets (`deploy.sh --with-{spectrum,att}-cake-autorate`). Spectrum CAKE: member-NIC `diffserv4 wash` 550M base DL autorate / fixed 18M UL. ATT: `diffserv4 nowash` 95M base DL autorate / fixed 19M UL.

## ✅ v1.53 Pluggable RTT Measurement Backend (Shipped 2026-06-19)

Full details: `milestones/v1.53-ROADMAP.md` · Requirements: `milestones/v1.53-REQUIREMENTS.md` · Audit: `milestones/v1.53-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`

Summary: introduced the `RttBackend` seam, kept `icmplib` byte-identical/default, implemented selectable `fping` with fallback and attribution, ran the live A/B, and closed with `stay-on-icmplib` after the pre-registered safety gate returned `rollback_trigger`. Future fping work is deferred as non-production `FPING-PROFILE-01`.

## Backlog

### Parallel (event-gated)

- **Phase 218 (v1.45 VERIFY watch-list)** — dormant. The flapping peak-counter instrumentation lives in the native wanctl controller, which no longer runs Spectrum/ATT; this watch item stays dormant unless `wanctl@` returns to live duty or the check is reimplemented against bridge/cake-autorate telemetry.

### Deferred (post-v1.53 candidates)

- **ROLE-01 (native-controller retirement decision)** — time/event-gated; needs ≥14 consecutive stable cake-autorate days PLUS one exercised rollback drill (v1.52 HIL harness enables the drill). `WANCTL_CAKE_AUTORATE_FUTURE.md` "What not to delete yet" governs until then; BOUND-01 guard protects the surface.
- **TAIL-01 (Spectrum loaded-latency tail)** — NOT exhausted per 2026-06-10 Codex review; valid future evidence/investigation milestone, different shape.
- **SEED-007 (storage hygiene fire-on-change)** — must be reshaped for bridge writers (state bridges now own metrics-DB writes) and requires a consumer audit before any sparse-write change. Deferred as its own thesis.
- **SEED-005 (conservative UL tuning sweep)** — deferred not dead; native wanctl remains first-class on RouterOS deployments.
- **RECLAIM-04** — Spectrum upload reclaim re-attempt with a fundamentally different probe shape. Carried indefinitely after Phase 215 bounded VOID exhaustion; now a cake-autorate config question (`adjust_ul_shaper_rate=1`) under fixed-18M UL.

### Deferred from v1.53 (future RTT-backend work)

- **IRTT-MIG-01** — migrate the existing IRTT path to a first-class `IrttBackend` behind the seam (v1.53 only shapes the Protocol to absorb it via SEAM-04).
- **FPING-JSON-01** — adopt `fping -J` structured JSON once the schema stabilizes and lands in the Debian/Ubuntu deploy baseline (5.1 ships alpha-only `-J`; parse stable text in v1.53).
- **NATIVE-AB-01** — stand up native autorate to validate fping on the native control path (currently dormant; inherits the seam passively).
