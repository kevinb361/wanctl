# Session State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-26)

**Core value:** Sub-second congestion detection with 50ms control loops
**Current focus:** v1.22 Full System Audit -- Phase 115 complete, Phase 116 next

## Position

**Milestone:** v1.22 Full System Audit
**Phase:** 116 of 116 (test & documentation hygiene)
**Plan:** Not started
**Status:** Ready to plan
**Last activity:** 2026-03-26

Progress: [█████████░] 92%

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

- 50ms cycle validated as optimal — measurement cadence feeds signal processing chain
- CAKE kernel autorate-ingress 250ms is irrelevant (different algorithm, different problem domain)
- pyroute2 netlink replaces subprocess tc (3ms → 0.3ms), no cycle interval change
- ATT fusion manually disabled due to ICMP/IRTT path divergence (correlation 0.74)
- metrics.db growing ~500MB/day — retention strategy required
- Prometheus export is optional, core operation remains self-contained
- 115-02: Production uses system Python (no venv); requests 2.32.3 below declared >=2.33.0 (CVE pending)
- 115-02: Backup runbook is documentation only (no automated backup) per OPSEC-04
- 115-03: Resource limits sized from production observation (MemoryMax=512M wanctl, 384M steering; MemoryHigh at 75% of max)
- 115-03: NIC tuning persistence confirmed via reboot -- wanctl-nic-tuning.service enabled and runs on boot

### Known Issues

- IRTT server is single point (Dallas 104.200.21.31:2112), no SLA
- VM inline on both WAN paths = single point of failure
- ATT fusion disabled — protocol correlation 0.74 causes permanent delta offset
- metrics.db at 521MB after 25h — disk fills in ~50 days at current rate
