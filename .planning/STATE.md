## Milestone Achievements

### v1.0 Performance Optimization (Shipped 2026-01-13)

**Goal:** Reduce measurement and control latency
**Achieved:** 50ms cycle interval (40x faster than 2s baseline)

### v1.1 Code Quality (Shipped 2026-01-14)

**Goal:** Improve code maintainability through systematic refactoring
**Achieved:**

- Consolidated utility modules (~350 lines removed)
- Extracted methods from WANController and SteeringDaemon
- Unified state machine
- Integrated Phase2BController with dry-run mode
- Added 120 new tests (474 → 594)

### v1.2 Configuration & Polish (Shipped 2026-01-14)

**Goal:** Complete Phase2B rollout, improve configuration documentation
**Achieved:**

- Fixed Phase2B timer interval (cycle_interval param)
- Documented baseline_rtt_bounds in CONFIG_SCHEMA.md
- Added deprecation warnings for legacy steering params
- Added config edge case tests (+77 tests, 594 → 671)
- Enabled Phase2B confidence scoring in dry-run mode

## Next Steps

1. Define v1.3 requirements from CONCERNS.md analysis
2. Create roadmap with phases 21+
3. Begin phase planning with `/gsd:plan-phase`
